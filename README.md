# Major Tom Gateway API Package
Python Package for interacting with Major Tom's Gateway API.

The Gateway API functions are accessible under the `GatewayAPI` class:

```

Use the `help()` function to see it's capability,
and check out our [demo gateway](https://github.com/kubos/example-python-gateway)
